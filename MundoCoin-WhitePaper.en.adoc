== Introduction

=== Development of cryptocurrencies

With the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, digital currencies have become an important part of the modern financial system. However, current cryptocurrencies still face a number of challenges, including issues with security, scalability, and user experience.MundoCoin's goal is to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital currency that provides users and businesses with convenient payment and transaction solutions.

=== What is MundoCoin?

MundoCoin is an open source digital currency project that uses blockchain technology to enable a fast, secure and scalable trading experience. The aim is to create a cryptocurrency ecosystem that is secure, fast and with high community engagement.

MundoCoin's goal is to provide users with a fast, convenient and cost-effective solution for trading and managing digital assets. It will make full use of blockchain technology and distributed ledgers to ensure the security and anonymity of transactions, and improve the speed of transactions and the scalability of the network through rational design and optimisation.

MundoCoin's vision is to become one of the world's leading digital currencies, used in a wide variety of scenarios, including commercial transactions, asset management and public services.
To realise this vision, MundoCoin is committed to providing the following features and benefits:

At the same time, we are committed to achieving more efficient transactions through the introduction of the concept of master nodes and mini-nodes, and to safeguarding the security of user assets through a modular design and a secure network.
We encourage community members to actively participate in community projects to promote MundoCoin.


== Technical overview

=== Blockchain technology foundation:

MundoCoin is based on distributed ledger technology, which enables the confirmation and recording of transactions through a blockchain network. The blockchain network consists of multiple nodes, each of which keeps a complete copy of the ledger. Transactions are packaged into blocks and linked together in chronological order to form a tamper-proof chain. The consistency of the ledger by the nodes in the network is ensured through a consensus mechanism.

=== Master and mini-nodes:

MundoCoin uses a master node and mini-node architecture. The master node is responsible for maintaining the security and stability of the network and handling the packing of transactions and blocks. Mini-nodes are ordinary nodes used to participate in consensus and verify the legitimacy of transactions. This division of labour architecture improves the processing power and scalability of the network.

==== Overview of master nodes

The master node is an important node in the MundoCoin network, which has the function of maintaining the stability and security of the blockchain. The master node performs tasks such as transaction verification, blockchain synchronisation, network integration, consensus algorithms and data storage, providing support for the entire network and ensuring its normal operation.

==== Mini Node Overview

In order to provide a convenient digital asset management and payment solution, MundoCoin will develop the Mini Node application. Users can easily conduct secure digital asset transactions and management on the mini-node and participate in the MundoCoin ecosystem anytime, anywhere.
Mini Node will support cryptographic security and user privacy protection mechanisms to ensure that users' digital assets are fully protected. Through the use of Mini Node, users can enjoy a safe, convenient and fast digital asset trading experience.
The Mini Node operates as a lightweight node that runs on mobile devices, enabling users to transact and participate in network consensus anytime, anywhere. Mini Node uses a simplified authentication process that balances performance and security.

=== Advantages of master and mini-nodes

The introduction of master nodes and mini-nodes is designed to accelerate transaction validation speed and overall network efficiency. The master node ensures the efficiency and accuracy of transaction validation by providing high-performance computing power and storage resources, while the mini-nodes increase the coverage of the network and improve the network availability through a distributed approach.

=== Modular design architecture:

MundoCoin adopts a modular design, dividing system functions and components into different modules for easy expansion and upgrading. The modular design helps improve development efficiency and system maintainability. At the same time, MundoCoin provides open APIs and interfaces for developers to integrate and customise their applications.


== Security network

=== Modular design

MundoCoin adopts a modular design, dividing the core functions into several independent modules, making the system easier to expand and maintain. Different modules are independent of each other and can be developed and updated independently, improving the flexibility of the system.

The modular design will facilitate the participation of more developers and innovators in the MundoCoin ecosystem, working together to drive growth and innovation in the project. We encourage developers to use our development tools and APIs to build applications more quickly and flexibly.

=== Security networks

In order to safeguard users' assets, MundoCoin has built a strong security network. The security network includes a variety of mechanisms, such as distributed ledgers, encryption technology and anti-attack measures. By using these mechanisms together, MundoCoin is able to effectively prevent risks such as fraud, tampering and double payments.

==== Cryptographic algorithms and encryption protocols

MundoCoin values the security and privacy of its users and employs advanced cryptographic algorithms and encryption protocols to safeguard the security of money transactions.
[sidebar]
.Wallet Security
--
MundoCoin uses asymmetric cryptographic algorithms to generate public-private key pairs for wallets. The private key is kept by the user in a secure environment and is used to sign transactions and authorise fund transfers. The public key is used to receive payment of funds and can be shared publicly with others. This asymmetric encryption is designed to ensure that only the user with the private key can control and use the funds in the wallet.
--
[sidebar]
.Transaction Security
--
MundoCoin transactions are verified by digital signatures. Each transaction is signed by the sender using its private key to prove that the transaction is legitimate and has not been tampered with. The receiver can use the sender's public key to verify the authenticity and integrity of the transaction. This digital signature mechanism ensures the security of the transaction against forgery and tampering.
--
[sidebar]
.Transmission Security
--
In order to ensure secure data transmission during transactions, MundoCoin uses cryptographic protocols to encrypt and protect data transmission. Using the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL/TLS), all transaction data is encrypted during transmission to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.
--
[sidebar]
.Preventing Double Payments
--
MundoCoin's blockchain network uses a decentralised consensus mechanism to prevent double payments. Double payments are situations where the same funds are used multiple times for different transactions, and MundoCoin's consensus mechanism prevents double payments by ensuring the order and uniqueness of transactions through timestamps and the chained structure of the blockchain.
--

=== Security measures:

In addition to cryptographic algorithms and encryption protocols, MundoCoin has taken other security measures to protect users' funds and accounts.

[sidebar]
.Multi-signature
--
MundoCoin supports multi-signature technology.
Multi-signature is a security measure that requires transactions to be co-signed by multiple related parties to ensure the security and trustworthiness of the transaction. Multi-signature technology can be used in various scenarios, such as corporate accounts, partner transactions, etc.
--
[sidebar]
.Cold Storage
--
MundoCoin encourages Users to store a large portion of their funds in Cold Storage, a form of offline storage that greatly reduces the risk of hacking. Cold Storage private keys are kept in an offline device (e.g. a hardware wallet or paper wallet), which is connected to the network only when needed to make transactions.
--
[sidebar]
.Security Audits
--
MundoCoin conducts regular security audits and vulnerability testing to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. At the same time, MundoCoin encourages community members to identify and report security issues, and offers rewards to encourage more security research and feedback.
--
[sidebar]
.Confidentiality and Privacy
--
MundoCoin is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Users' personal information. Users' identity and transaction data will be kept strictly confidential and in compliance with applicable privacy protection laws and regulations.
--
[sidebar]
.Disaster Preparedness
--
MundoCoin responds to unforeseen events and system failures by establishing a disaster recovery system and a backup strategy. The disaster recovery system can continue to operate in the event of a primary system failure or network outage, guaranteeing the safety of users' funds and the continuity of transactions.

image::01.png[align=center]


=== Node Voucher

*Name*: MundoCoinNode

*Symbol*: MCN

*Total supply*: Approximately 120 MCN new per year

image::02.png[align=center]

* *What are node vouchers*

- The MundoCoinNode (MCN) is the credentials to run the master node and is the ID of the master node.
- The MundoCoin Genesis block will generate 120 MCNs, after which a new MCN will be generated every 438 blocks (about 120 MCNs generated per year), and the newly generated MCNs will go directly into the project fund pool, which can be taken by any member of the community through the auction system.
- The first 120 MCNs generated by the Genesis Block will be distributed to community members through tasks, events and auctions.

* *Why Introduce Nodal Credentials*

- MCN is used for initial node screening, preventing the establishment of malicious nodes and blocking 51% attacks, and is the first line of defence for MundoCoin network security.

- MCN acts as the identity ID of the node with uniqueness; once the node is found to have cheating and malicious attacks, the MCN with malicious behaviour will be monitored to prevent the malicious node from changing IP to attack again after its attack is intercepted, which is the second line of defence for MundoCoin network security.

- When a node's malicious behaviour stops, the monitored MCN needs enough time to recover its credit, and the node can only continue to receive rewards when its credit is restored, and if the MCN has multiple malicious behaviours, it will be permanently banned.




* *Node IDs have important functions and benefits in distributed systems and blockchain networks*

1. Uniqueness: node ID is the unique identification of each node in the network. Through node ID, different nodes can be distinguished and identified. This ensures that there are no duplicate nodes in the network and avoids conflicts and confusion.

2. Routing and communication: node ID plays the role of routing and communication in the network. Other nodes can use node IDs to locate specific nodes for messaging, interaction and data transfer. Node IDs can help to establish reliable communication connections and ensure effective interaction between nodes.

3. Data Consistency: In distributed systems, node IDs can be used to achieve data consistency and replication. By assigning unique IDs to nodes, it can be ensured that data copies are correctly synchronised and updated between different nodes, thus maintaining data consistency throughout the system.

4. Load Balancing: Node IDs can be used to implement load balancing and resource allocation. By optimising and allocating node IDs, loads and tasks can be evenly distributed across the system, improving system performance and scalability.

5. Security and Privilege Management: Node IDs can be used to implement security and privilege management. By verifying and authorising node IDs, the access rights and operating privileges of specific nodes can be restricted to improve the security and protection of the system.

These are necessary to build a powerful, efficient and reliable distributed system.

=== Fast Transactions

MundoCoin adopts the consensus mechanism of proof of co-operation, which reduces the time of block confirmation, and every transaction can be done in real time.

Basic workflow:

image::03.png[align=center]

When Wallet A sends an MNO transfer to Wallet B, Wallet B will send this record to a node in the MundoCoin network at the same time as it receives the MNO, and the node will share the received record in real time with other nodes, and archive all the records when the next block is generated. (Any behaviour generated throughout the process will be recorded!)


==== MundoCoin Payment Principle

[sidebar]
.Key Generation
--
When A pays MNO to B, A will first send a request to Node, which will generate a pair of RSA keys, including public and private keys, and Node will send the public key to A.
--
[sidebar]
.Order encryption
--
A's payment request will generate order information, which is encrypted using the Node's public key to ensure that the order information is not easily stolen or tampered with during transmission.
--
[sidebar]
.Data transmission and verification
--
A sends the encrypted order information to the Node. Since the order information is encrypted with the Node's public key, only the Node's private key can decrypt the original order information, and the Node will verify that the order information sent by A is complete and has not been tampered with.
--
[sidebar]
.Signature Generation
--
Node digitally signs the order information with its own private key and generates signed data. The signature process uses an algorithm-specific digital signature mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of the order information.
--
[sidebar]
.Signature Verification
--
A receives the order information and signature data from Node, and then uses Node's public key to verify the signature data. If the verification passes, it can be confirmed that the order data comes from Node and the order information has not been tampered with.
--
[sidebar]
.Payment Completion
--
After the validation passes, A will pay MNO to B successfully.
--

image::04.png[align=center]

.Regarding the payment principle of MundoCoin, I'll illustrate it with an example！
For example, if A wants to transfer 100MNO to B, B needs to submit the information to the Notary Office (node) first, then the Notary Office (node) will review the information, and if the review passes, it will arrange for the Notary Public (MiniNode) to witness the transaction and validate the balance, and the Notary Public (MiniNode) confirms that B receives the 100MNO, and then the Notary Public (MiniNode) will record the result in the block information.

[sidebar]
.RSA Algorithm
--
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that was co-proposed in 1977 by three computer scientists, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, and is named after their last names.

The security of the RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty of the prime factorisation problem. As long as the large prime numbers are kept private, it is very difficult for others to break the ciphertext to obtain the plaintext.The RSA algorithm is widely used in the fields of encrypted communication, digital signatures and authentication. It is still one of the most commonly used asymmetric encryption algorithms due to its security and reliability.

.RSA algorithm principle
--
The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that includes both public and private keys. Its principle is based on the mathematical property in number theory that multiplication of two large prime numbers is difficult to decompose.

Key generation:

a. Choose two large prime numbers p and q at random.

b. Compute stem:[N = p * q].

c. Compute the Euler function stem:[\varphi(N) = (p-1) * (q-1)].

d. Choose an integer stem:[e] satisfying stem:[1 < e < \varphi(N)] and stem:[e] and stem:[\varphi(N)] are mutually prime.

e. Compute the multiplicative inverse stem:[d] of stem:[e % \varphi(N)] such that stem:[(e * d) % \varphi(N) = 1].

f. The public key is stem:[(e, N)] and the private key is stem:[(d, N)].

Encryption:

a. Convert the plaintext stem:[M] to an integer stem:[m], satisfying stem:[0 <= m < N].

b. Encrypt to get ciphertext stem:[C, C = (m^e) % N].

Decryption:

a. Decrypt the ciphertext stem:[C] using the private key stem:[(d, N)] to get the plaintext stem:[m], stem:[m = (C^d) % N].

.ECC Algorithm
Elliptic Curve Cryptography: ECC is a very strong and efficient public key cryptography algorithm. It is a public key cryptography algorithm based on the mathematics of elliptic curves. It exploits the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves to provide security for encryption and authentication.

.Here is the general working of ECC
[sidebar]
.Elliptic Curve
--
ECC uses points on an elliptic curve as the basis of the encryption algorithm. An elliptic curve is defined as the set of points that satisfy a particular equation, which typically uses operations over a finite field. On elliptic curves, operations such as addition and multiplication of points can be performed.

.Public and Private Key Generation
--
ECC uses a pair of keys, including a private key and a public key. The private key is kept by the user, while the public key can be shared publicly. The private key is a random number and the public key is generated by the operation of the private key and points on an elliptic curve.
--
[sidebar]
.KEY EXCHANGE
--
ECC can be used in key exchange protocols where two communicating parties can generate a shared secret key by pointwise operations on elliptic curves. This process is called ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) protocol.
--
[sidebar]
.Digital Signature
--
ECC can also be used to generate and verify digital signatures. The sender signs the data using the private key and the receiver uses the sender's public key to verify the validity of the signature to ensure data integrity and authentication.

ECC can use shorter key lengths for the same level of security, thus providing higher computational efficiency and a smaller resource footprint. This makes ECC more practical in resource-constrained environments (e.g., mobile devices, IoT devices, etc.).

.Common formulas for calculations in ECC:
[sidebar]

Elliptic curve equation: an elliptic curve can be defined by an equation, usually written:

stem:[y^2 = x^3 + ax + b]

where a and b are parameters on the curve, which can be negative, integers in the domain range.

Addition of points : Addition of two points stem:[P(x1, y1)] and stem:[Q(x2, y2)] on an elliptic curve is defined as follows:

If stem:[P] and stem:[Q] are the same point (i.e., stem:[P = Q]), multiplication of points is performed.

If stem:[P] and stem:[Q] are different points, the result of stem:[P + Q] is computed according to the following equation:

stem:[\lambda = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)]

stem:[x3 = \lambda^2 - x1 - x2]

stem:[y3 = \lambda(x1 - x3) - y]

The result is stem:[R(x3, y3)], which is another point on the curve.

Multiplication of points : The multiplication of a point stem:[P(x, y)] on an elliptic curve is defined as follows:

If n is a positive integer, then nP is equal to adding P to itself n times, i.e. stem:[nP = P + P + ... + P (n times)].

.Secure Socket Layer Protocol (SSL/TLS)
[sidebar]
--
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are a pair of encrypted communication protocols widely used to secure network communications.

The main goal of SSL/TLS is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authentication of data through encrypted communication. They establish a secure connection between a Web browser and a server, preventing third parties from eavesdropping on, tampering with, or impersonating the communication.
--

.SSL/TLS works as follows
[sidebar]
--
Handshake Protocol: At the beginning of the communication, a handshake protocol is executed between the client and the server. During this process, they exchange encrypted information, negotiate the encryption algorithm and key to be used, and perform authentication.

Encrypted Communication: Once the handshake process is complete, communication between the client and the server encrypts the data using the negotiated encryption algorithm. This way, even if someone intercepts the communication, they will not be able to decipher its contents.

Digital certificates: For authentication purposes, the server provides a digital certificate that contains information about the server and a public key. The client verifies the validity of the certificate and uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt a randomly generated key for symmetric encryption during the session.

Symmetric Encryption and Message Authentication: During a TLS session, a symmetric encryption algorithm is used between the client and server to encrypt and decrypt data. Message Authentication Code (MAC) is also used to ensure the integrity of the message. Commonly used symmetric encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

Terminate Connection: Once the communication is complete, the client and server can terminate the connection and release the associated resources.

=== Proof of Cooperation (PoC)

Proof of Cooperation (PoC) is a consensus mechanism for verifying and confirming transactions and generating new blocks in a blockchain network.
[sidebar]
--
Unlike traditional algorithms such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, Proof of Cooperation emphasises cooperation and collaboration between participants to determine the generation of the next block.

In Proof of Cooperation, participants prove their integrity and trustworthiness by demonstrating cooperative behaviour among themselves. It is used to confirm cooperative behaviour between participants.

Unlike other consensus mechanisms (such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake), Co-operative Proof focuses on co-operation and collaboration between participants rather than on computing power or size of shareholding.

All Master-Nodes will be formed into a cluster of servers that share the responsibility of so authenticating requests, confirming requests, storing data, etc.
--

.The modus operandi of the Cooperative Certification Mechanism is as follows:

.. Data storage: participants use their own computers or devices to store a portion of the data on the blockchain network. This data can include transaction records, block header information, etc.

.. Data validation and processing: participants are responsible for validating and processing the stored data. They need to access and query the data to ensure its correctness and integrity.

.. Block Generation: The contribution level of the participants will be used to determine the next block to be generated. Typically, participants with higher contribution levels get a better chance of generating a new block.

.. Goal Setting: Participants determine a common goal or task. This could be solving a problem, completing a project or achieving a common benefit.

.. Proof of Cooperative Behaviour: participants demonstrate their cooperative behaviour in reaching a common goal. This may include sharing resources, providing assistance, sharing risks, collaborating to solve problems, etc.

.. Proof validation: other participants or validation nodes validate the participants' collaborative behaviour. This can be done by sharing records, exchanging information, reviewing evidence, etc.

.. Reward distribution: verified participants will receive appropriate rewards or entitlements based on their cooperative behaviour.

The cooperative proof mechanism emphasises active cooperation and resource sharing among participants in the network to ensure the security and reliability of the network. Compared to other consensus algorithms, the advantage of cooperative proof is that it emphasises co-operation and collaboration, encourages mutual assistance and trust among participants, it promotes healthy competition among participants rather than competitive waste of resources, it reduces energy consumption and hardware equipment requirements, and it promotes the common development of the community.

=== DNS Nodes
A node that is running for the first time will contact the node providing DNS services to get a list of available nodes and then continue to try to connect to those nodes and participate in the network.
After that it will disconnect from the node providing DNS services, as it has already obtained all the information it needs from that node.

* DNS node information will be hardcoded into the software with the following names

 node01.mundocoin.top
 node02.mundocoin.top
 etc.

* The user-managed nodes will be the smart/master nodes and the main body of the network, with the aim of making the network resilient and fully decentralised.
* These DNS nodes managed by us will have no say in blockchain processing and will not have the power to freeze.
* They simply support the launch of the network by providing a list of non-DNS nodes connected to the network.
